# This is a Totally Awesome Project

I'm your friendly Markdown file. You can find me in the **works** folder of this site if you wish to edit me. 

It's easier to see what's going on under the hood if you look inside the file and compare it to what's rendered here.

At the top you'll notice two lots of three --- dashes. The content included between those lines is called **Front-Matter**. It's used by search engines and GraphQL when querying data.

Do your research on [Markdown Files](https://www.markdownguide.org/). There's nothing to worry about.

If you want to include a heading you use the hash # symbol like so:

# H1 Size Heading

## H2 Size Heading

### H3 Size Heading

Right up to H6 size headings - just include from 1 to 6 hashes. Easy.

To do a list you just write List then a hyphen or a dash -

List
- Cats
- Dogs
- Birds

It's really easy - that's why it was chosen for the [Jamstack!](https://jamstack.org/)

**Bold** (and asterixes for bold text)

*Italic*

'Monospace'

### Links

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

You can also find more information in the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

Good luck!
